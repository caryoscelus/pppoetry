title: "was it me who stayed with you (Anna Akhmatova)"
---

```
was it me who stayed with you,
was it you who left with me,
but it didn't really happen —
separation — dear angel! 

and no sigh of bluish sadness,
not an intricate reproach,
fills me with a darker horror
your most calm and clear glance.
```
