title: i'll drink
---

```
i'll drink with you a glass of water,
but the blood is never forgotten.
i just seek in the dark for traces of void
unexplored, unawoken.

you still hold an empty goblet,
i still feel a strawberry token,
but the metal ablaze in the hand of the prophet.
you, your life and your ideal â€”
broken.
```
