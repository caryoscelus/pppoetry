title: "please make me feel"
---

```
please make me feel like i am not
like i am not the only one
please make me see that there is light
that there is light beyond this night
one of them will i become?
i wish! i do! i do not want

i want to feel like i am not
that cold and lifeless wooden doll
i want to feel like i'm alive
but there is no one who is i!

please try to hear my silent song
my silent song my silent scream
please let me share my hopeless dream
keep seeing it for days to come
until the time when there is not
when there is not a single soul
who cares to live like there is hope
and sees the sky beyond the dirt

i feel i want to like what i
have seen or heard across the globe
but what is this? this wretched life
this useless pain and wicked thoughts
and boredom of repeating days
which turns the rainbow into grays
and irredeemable disgrace
and empty lonely human space
eternal curse of evil ways
which bound to rule this gloomy place

the hope is lost and so am i
a warmless spark at best at most
a glimpse of shadow in the dark
of endless maze inside the time
```
