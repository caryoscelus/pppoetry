```
how often weep we — you and i —
our miserable lives
oh, my friends, if you would know
the cold and dark of days to come

you shake the hand of your beloved
play with her, and tease
and cry you, seeing lie
or in her hand a knife
  you kid, you kid

lies and cunning without measure
and death is far
still blacker becoming scary light,
and still more crazy planet storm
  more ages, more!

and age the last, scariest still
  will witness you and i
all sky will be hidden by filthy sin
and laugh will freeze on all the lips
  sadness of being not

spring, my child, you will wait
  spring will lie
you'll call the sun into the sky
  the sun won't rise
and scream, when you will start to scream
  as rock, will die

so be content with life of yours
  quieter than water, below the grass
oh, if you'd know, kids, you
  the cold and dark of days to come
```
